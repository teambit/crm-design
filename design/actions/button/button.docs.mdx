## Button Component

The `Button` component offers a flexible way to create interactive buttons with different styles, handling both standard button actions and navigation links.

## Usage

### Primary Button

A primary button is used for the main action on a page.

```jsx
<Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => alert('Primary Button Clicked!')}>
  Primary Button
</Button>
```
### Secondary Button
A secondary button is used for less important actions.
```jsx
<Button appearance="secondary" onClick={() => alert('Secondary Button Clicked!')}>
  Secondary Button
</Button>
```
### Tertiary Button
A tertiary button is used for the least important actions, often as a simple text link alternative.
```jsx
<Button appearance="tertiary" onClick={() => alert('Tertiary Button Clicked!')}>
  Tertiary Button
</Button>
```
### Button as a Link
The `Button` component can also be used as a link by providing the `href` prop.
```jsx
<Button href="/dashboard" appearance="primary">
  Go to Dashboard
</Button>
