The `Link` component facilitates navigation within your application using React Router, and also supports linking to external websites. It handles both internal and external links, applying appropriate attributes and behaviors.

## Internal Links

Internal links use React Router for smooth, client-side navigation within your application.

```tsx
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>
  <Link href="/profile">View User Profile</Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This example demonstrates a basic internal link. Clicking this link will navigate the user to the `/profile` route within your application, without a full page reload.
## External Links
External links point to resources outside of your application. These links automatically open in a new tab for a better user experience.
```tsx
<MemoryRouter>
  <Link href="https://www.example.com" external>
    Visit Example.com (New Tab)
  </Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
Here, the `external` prop signals that the link is external. The component automatically adds `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes for security and usability.
## Custom Styling
You can apply custom styles to the Link component using CSS classes.
```tsx
<MemoryRouter>
  <style>{`
    .special-link {
      font-size: var(--typography-sizes-body-large);
      color: var(--colors-actions-create);
    }
  `}</style>
  <Link href="/special-offer" className="special-link">
    Check out our Special Offer!
  </Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This example shows how to use a custom CSS class to style the link, changing its font size and color. This allows for flexible integration with your application's design system.
