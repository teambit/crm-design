## Component Usage

Use the `Paragraph` component to display blocks of text with consistent styling and optimal readability.

```jsx
<Paragraph>
  This is a basic paragraph. It uses default styling for font size, line height, and color to ensure readability.
</Paragraph>
```
### Custom Element
The `element` prop allows you to render the paragraph as a different HTML element, such as a `div` or `span`.
```jsx
<Paragraph element="div">
  This paragraph is rendered as a div. This is useful for layout purposes or when you need to apply specific styles to a block-level element.
</Paragraph>
```
### Custom Styling
You can apply custom styles to the paragraph using the `className` and `style` props.
```jsx
<Paragraph className="custom-class" style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  This paragraph has custom styling applied. You can use CSS classes or inline styles to modify the appearance of the text.
</Paragraph>
```
### Multiple Paragraphs
Use multiple `Paragraph` components to display a series of paragraphs with consistent spacing.
```jsx
<Paragraph>
  This is the first paragraph. It includes default styling for font size, line height and color.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  This is the second paragraph. Note the consistent spacing between paragraphs.
</Paragraph>
