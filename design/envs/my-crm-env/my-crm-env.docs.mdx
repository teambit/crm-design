A reusable development environment for React, tailored for CRM applications.
Use this environment to create new React components and apps within the My CRM ecosystem.

Features:
- ▶️ TypeScript
- 🧪 Vitest
- 🧑‍💻 Generator templates include React UI component, React hook and apps (including Vite + SSR).
- 🚀 React Workspace starter for CRM projects.
- 🦋 ESLint
- ⚒️ A React optimized build pipeline.
- 👓 React Preview, pre-configured with MyCrmTheme.

## Use in existing workspaces

Add the development env to your generator configuration on `workspace.jsonc`.

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "my-org/my-scope/my-crm-env"
    ]
  }
}
```
You can see the generator templates in your workspace using `bit templates`.
## Use on an existing component
Use this dev environment on your existing components, by running the following command:
```
bit env set my-component my-org/my-scope/my-crm-env
```
## Create a React workspace for CRM
You can create a new React workspace made from this env using the following command:
```
bit new react my-crm-workspace --aspect my-org/my-scope/my-crm-env
```
## Compose your own env
You can base on this env, and customize it to your needs. To create your env run this command:
```
bit create react-env my-new-crm-env --scope my-org.my-scope
```
Make sure your new environment class extends this env class (`MyCrmEnv`) and overrides the needed class methods.
